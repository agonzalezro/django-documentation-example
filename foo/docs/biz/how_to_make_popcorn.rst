How to make popcorn
===================

Really I just wanted to show this funny graph:

.. digraph:: foo

    "buy popcorn" -> "open microwave" -> "place popcorn inside" -> "cook for 3 minutes"

I will not say anything, but imaging this graphs talking about service
communication (wink wink).

This will be your result:

I am pretty sure that you are clever enough to read the reStructuredText
documentation and find out how to write a proper document.
