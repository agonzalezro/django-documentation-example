.. Just an example documentation master file, created by
   sphinx-quickstart on Thu May  2 15:06:15 2013.
   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Just an example's documentation!
===========================================

Introduction
------------

IMHO, the best thing that you can do is let Sphinx generate the documentation
for you, and write some reStructuredText files for explain the business logic.

In this example you will find the autogenerated documentation in `modules/` and
the businnes one in `biz/`.

Business logic documents
------------------------

This is the one write by me directly on `rst` files:

.. toctree::
    biz/how_to_make_popcorn

Autodocumented code
-------------------

.. toctree::
    modules/bar

Indices and tables
==================

* :ref:`genindex`
* :ref:`modindex`
* :ref:`search`
